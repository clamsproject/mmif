- Running LAPPS tools
THINK!
It does seem we need converters.

- Context
Need to do this better than for LAPPS

- Vocab Intro
Add that MMIF can also refer to LAPPS vocab

- Service metadata
To be copied to the view metadata?

- Primary data
Pointer to local through location property cannot be a URI since that would not
allow local paths.  (By the way, there is no @location property in JSON-LD)

- Region > unit
Is now a metadata property. Add as regular property so it can be overruled?

- BoundingBox
Using coordinates is better than top-left etcetera.
Is now 2D or 3D. Is that okay. We can make it 2D and instead of Segment we could
let it refer to a TimeStamp if in video.

- Span
Included now. Has start, end and targets, note we have those on Segment as well,
do we care?
Somehat redundant since we have Region in WSEV, also somewhat confusing since
Region is something different in LAPPS and CLAMS. Is there another word for
Region?

- TimePoint
Maybe call it Time? If we call it TimePoint, should we rename Segment into
TimeInterval or TimeFrame?
Originally we had TimeFrame and Segment with TimeFrame being more general.

- Alignment
Need better names for region1 and region1_type
Maybe source and target?

- Annotation > medium
Should this be a property of an annotation type? Maybe it is a property of a
view, and maybe so is producer.

- Annotation > rules
Should this be a metadata property on the annotation type?  Maybe we allow all
kinds of parameters relative to the tool. Maybe we put this on the tool.
