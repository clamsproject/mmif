  Abstract top type.

properties:
  id:
    type: ID
    description: >-
      A unique identifier for the annotation or document. Uniqueness is relative to the view
      the annotation is in or the list of documents at the top level of a MMIF file.
    required: true

---

name: Annotation
parent: Thing

description: >-
  Any kind of information added to a document. 
  If an annotation is specific to a region over the primary data or a relation over such regions, 
  specific sub-types should be used instead of this high-level type. 


metadata:
  document:
    type: ID
    description: >-
      The identifier of the document that the annotation is over. This has to be
      defined either at the metadata level, in which case it has scope over all
      annotations of the same type in a view, or at the instance level, in which
      it has scope over just the single annotation.

properties:
  document:
    type: ID
    description: >-
      The identifier of the document that the annotation is over.


---

name: Region
parent: Annotation

description: >-
  An annotation over a region in primary data where primary data can be a text,
  an image, an audio stream or a video streem. Typically one of the sub types
  of this will be used.

metadata:
  timeUnit:
    type: String
    description: >-
      Specifies which unit of time the measurement is based. 
      Can be *seconds* or *milliseconds*, or in case of annotations on 
      a VideoDocument, *frames*. 

---

name: TimePoint
parent: Region

description: >-
  A time point in an audio or video stream.

properties:
  timePoint:
    type: Integer
    description: The starting offset in the stream.
    required: true

---

name: Interval
parent: Region

description: >-
  An annotation over an interval of linear primary data, either a text, a video 
  or audio stream. An Interval may be defined by pointing directly into 
  primary data (by using start and end offsets) or by linking to one or
  more other Annotations with the targets property. This annotation type is
  intended to be an abstract type and typically one of the sub types will be
  used.

properties:
  start:
    type: Integer
    description: >-
      The starting offset in the primary data. This point is inclusive. 
      For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key.
      For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point. 
  end:
    type: Integer
    description: >-
      The ending offset in the primary data. This point is exclusive. 
      For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key.
      For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point. 
  targets:
    type: List of IDs
    description: >-
      IDs of a sequence of annotations covering the region of primary data
      referred to by this annotation. Used as an alternative to *start* and
      *end* to point to component annotations (for example a token sequence)
      rather than directly into primary data, or to link two or more annotations
      (for example in a coreference annotation).

---

name: Span
parent: Interval

similarTo: http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Region

description: >-
  An annotation over a region in primary text data. A Span may be defined by
  pointing directly into primary data (by using start and end offsets) or
  by linking to one or more other Annotations with the targets property.

---

name: TimeFrame
parent: Interval

description: >-
  A temporal interval in an audio or video stream. This is similar to the term
  segment used in audio processing, but that term has a different meaning in the
  image and video community.

properties:
  frameType:
    type: String
    description: The type of TimeFrame. Could be bars-and-tones, speech, noise, music, other.

---

name: Chapter
parent: TimeFrame
description: >-
  Example case for when we do not want to use Segment with a specific
  segmentType or if we want to introduce special properties.

properties:
  title:
    type: String
    description: Title of the chapter

---

name: Polygon
parent: Region

description: >-
  A polygon in an image or video. This is a two-dimensional object so if this
  occurs in a video it will be anchored to a particular frame or time point in
  the video.

properties:
  coordinates:
    type: List of pairs
    description: The coordinates of the polygon, taking the top-left of the image
      as the origin (0,0). Unit used to measure the distance is the number of pixels.
    required: true
  timePoint:
    type: Integer
    description: If on a video stream, the TimePoint that the BoundingBox occurs in.

---

name: BoundingBox
parent: Polygon

description: >-
  A rectangular object in an image or video. At the moment it does not have
  features that would not make any sense on its parent type Polygon so
  technically we can do without BoundingBox, but it was introduced because the
  term is in widespread use.

properties:
  boxType:
    type: String
    description: The type of BoundingBox. Mostly used for text boxes where we use the value text.

---

name: VideoObject
parent: Region

description: >-
  A sequence of Polygons, where each Polygon is associated with a
  TimePoint. So a VideoObject is in effect a sequence of image objects at
  certain time points.
  
properties:
  polygons:
    type: List of IDs
    description: The Polygons that make up the object.
    required: true

---

name: Relation
parent: Annotation

description: >-
  Any relationship between two or more annotation types. For texts could be a
  grammatical relation such as subject-object, a semantic relation between
  meanings or roles, or a temporal relation indicating the simultaneity or
  ordering in time of events or states. For image regions and video objects this
  could involve spatial relations or part-whole relations.

---

name: Document
parent: Thing

description: >-
  A document of some media type. Annotations directly or indirectly anchor to
  documents. In CLAMS, a document typically refers to an external file fia the
  *location* property, but for text documents the actual content can be in-line
  in the document type.

properties:
  location:
    type: String
    description: The location of an external file.
  mime:
    type: String or URI
    description: The MIME type of the document, only used when the *location* property is used.

---

name: VideoDocument
parent: Document

description: >-
  A video document.

---

name: AudioDocument
parent: Document

description: >-
  An audio document.

---

name: ImageDocument
parent: Document

description: >-
  An image document.

---

name: TextDocument
parent: Document

description: >-
  A text document.

properties:
  text:
    type: Object
    description: >-
      A JSON-LD value object which has a *@value* and a *@language* property.

---

name: Alignment
parent: Thing

description: >-
  An alignment between two regions, two documents or a region and a
  document. Typically one of the regions or documents is a text span or text
  document and the other an image or audio segment or document. While there is no
  enforced directionality we tend to consider the text region or document as the
  target of the alignment.

metadata:
  sourceType:
    type: URI
    description: >-
      The type of sources of the alignment. When an alignment starts from more that two source types, namely sources can be different types, one should not use this metadata.

  targetType:
    type: URI
    description: >-
      The type of targets of the alignment. When an alignment goes to more that two target types, namely targets can be different types, one should not use this metadata.

properties:
  source:
    type: ID
    description: The first of the aligned regions or documents.
    required: true
  target:
    type: ID
    description: The second of the aligned regions or documents.
    required: true
