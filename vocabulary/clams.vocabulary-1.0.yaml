name: Annotation
parent: null

description: >-
  Any kind of information added to primary data. Could be a region over the
  primary data or a relation over regions.

metadata:
  medium:
    type: ID
    description: The identifier of the medium that the annotation is over.
    required: true
  producer:
    type: List of URI
    description: The software that produced the annotations.
  rules:
    type: List of URI
    description: The documentation (if any) for the rules that were used to identify the annotations.
  
properties:
  id:
    type: ID
    description: >-
      A unique identifier for the annotation. Uniqueness is relative to the view
      the annotation is in.
    required: true

name: Region
parent: Annotation

description: >-
  An annotation over a region in primary data where primary data can be a text,
  an image, an audio stream or a video streem. Typically one of the sub types
  of this will be used.

metadata:

  unit:
    type: String
    description: >-
      The unit used to determine boundaries. For text regions this is typically
      *offsets* to indicate character offsets, for images this is could be
      *coordinates*, and for audio or video streams *seconds*, *milliseconds*,
      *timestamps* or *frames*.

name: Span
parent: Region

similarTo: http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Region

description: >-
  An annotation over a region in primary text data. A Span may be defined by
  pointing directly into primary data (by using start and end offsets) or
  by linking to one or more other Annotations with the targets property.

properties:
  targets:
    type: List of IDs
    description: >-
      IDs of a sequence of annotations covering the region of primary data
      referred to by this annotation. Used as an alternative to <em>start</em>
      and <em>end</em> to point to component annotations (e.g., a token
      sequence) rather than directly into primary data, or to link two or more
      annotations (e.g., in a coreference annotation).
    start:
      type: Integer
      description: The starting offset (0-based) in the primary data.
    end:
      type: Integer
      description: The ending offset (0-based) in the primary data.

name: Segment
parent: Region

description: >-
  A time segment in an audio or video stream. Has sometimes been called TimeFrame.

properties:
  start:
    type: Integer
    description: The starting offset in the stream.
    required: true
  end:
    type: Integer
    description: The ending offset in the stream. If not used the Segment is a timepoint.
  segmentType:
    type: String
    description: The type of Segment. Could be bars-and-tones, speech, noise, music, other.

  Example case for when we do not want to use segmentType or if we want to
  introduce special properties.
  
properties:

    type: String
    description: Title of the chapter

name: BoundingBox
parent: Region

description: >-
  A polygon in an image or video. NOTE: maybe restrict this to images only (so
  the segment property would disappear) and then always use VideoObject when we
  introduce the third dimension.

properties:
  coordinates:
    type: List of pairs
    description: The coordinates of the polygon.
    required: true
  segment:
    type: ID
    description: If on a video, the Segment that the BoundingBox occurs in.

---

name: VideoObject
parent: Region

description: >-
  A sequence of BoundingBoxes, each BoundingBox is assumed to be associated with
  a Segment.
  
properties:
  boundingBoxes:
    type: List of IDs
    description: The BoundingBoxes that make up the object.
    required: true

---

name: Relation
parent: Annotation

description: >-
  Any relationship between two or more annotation types. For texts could be a
  grammatical relation such as subject-object, a semantic relation between
  meanings or roles, or a temporal relation indicating the simultaneity or
  ordering in time of events or states. For image regions and video objects this
  could invloves spatial relations or part-whole relations.
